ANY FILE THAT IS A .Designer.cs FILE WAS GENERATED BY WINDOWS VISUAL STUDIO DURING CREATION OF THE UI AND NOT WRITTEN BY US.

Any .resx file is a resource file. This manages the paths to all resources. THE ONLY RESOURCE FILE WE EDITED WAS Resources.resx IN THE PROPERTIES FOLDER. We're not sure if
you can open .resx files without Visual Studio.

The Resouces folder is where all all our resources come from.

All images contained within the Resources folder were created and originated for this project.
THE POKEBALLS WERE INSPIRED BY THE IMAGE FROM THIS WEBSITE https://www.kindpng.com/imgv/mRRbJR_pixel-art-pokemon-master-ball-hd-png-download/

The music file was written by our group using the website https://www.beepbox.co

In order to run the code, you should head to bin\Release\net8.0-windows10.0.22621.0\ and run the OFFICIAL-Pokemon-Project-FINAL.exe. This should open our application
and allow you to run the program we created. If there is an issue, please reach out to us and we can help resolve an issue. MUST BE RAN ON A WINDOWS COMPUTER.

If any issues or confusion come up, please contact us and we can help figure out the problem.
